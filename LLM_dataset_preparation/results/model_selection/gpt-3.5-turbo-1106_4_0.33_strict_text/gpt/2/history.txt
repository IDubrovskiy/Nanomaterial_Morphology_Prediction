First, 50 mkl of 1 M CaCl2 was mixed with 20 mkl of 0.0 % wt. nan polymer with molecular weight of 0.0 kDa. Then, 7.8 mkl of tert-Butanol was added, following adjustment with distilled water up to 500 mkl. Then, 74 mkl of 0.1 M Na2CO3 was mixed with 186 mkl of 0.1 M of NaHCO3 and 20 mkl of 1.175 % wt. Myristyltrimethylammonium bromide as surfactant. Then, 7.8 mkl of tert-Butanol was added, following adjustment with distilled water up to 500 mkl. Two resulting solutions, heated up to 50 C before the reaction, were mixed under the stirring with 0 rpm, while the temperature kept unchanged. Reaction proceeded for 4 min 15 sec min following centrifugation.

Firstly, 39 mkl of 1 M CaCl2 was mixed with 20 mkl of 0.0 % wt. nan polymer with 0.0 kDa molecular weight. Then, 34.0 mkl of Ethylene glycol was added, following adjustment up to 500 mkl by distilled water. Secondly, 243 mkl of 0.1 M Na2CO3 was mixed with 0 mkl of 0.1 M of NaHCO3 and 20 mkl of 0.21 % wt. Sodium dodecylsulfate. Then, 34.0 mkl of Ethylene glycol was added, following adjustment with distilled water up to 500 mkl. Two resulting solutions, heated up to 50 C before the reaction, were mixed under the stirring with 0 rpm, while the temperature kept unchanged. Reaction proceeded for 3 min 15 sec min following centrifugation.

true: Cuberequest: 68CaCO3 nanoparticles were synthesized by the co-precipitation technique. 1 M CaCl2 122 mkl and 20 mkl of 0.0 % wt. nan polymer with 0.0 kDa molecular weight were mixed. Then, 18.4 mkl of tert-Butanol was added as a solvent, after that the solution was diluted to 500 mkl by distilled water. Further, 205 mkl of 0.1 M Na2CO3 and 0 mkl of 0.1 M of NaHCO3 was mixed, 20 mkl of 0.12 % wt. Myristyltrimethylammonium bromide was added as a surfactant. Then, 18.4 mkl of tert-Butanol solvent was added, the solution was diluted to 500 mkl by distilled water. Two obtained solutions were heated up to 26 C before the reaction and mixed under the stirring with 0 rpm at constant temperature. Reaction was carried out for 18 min 25 sec min following centrifugation.
